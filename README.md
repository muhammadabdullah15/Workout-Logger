## Abstract

The deliverable of the project is a fitness web app called 'Digital Fitness Diary'. Our web app offers four main modules for the users to use, which are Exercise, Food, water intake, and challenges. These modules aim to support and aid the users to practice a healthy lifestyle using accurate calorie tracking and participation in workout challenges. Using the exercise section, users can track their performed workouts. The core technology involved in this section is GPS because it is highly essential when it comes to location tracking of people and allows accurate tracking of workouts.
However, a healthy lifestyle cannot be practiced perfectly by exercise only, as the role of diet is also extremely crucial. The users will be able to keep track of their consumed calories by following a recommended diet plan tailored to their body specifics. At the same time, the users can keep an
eye on their daily water intake because a sufficient amount of water intake is necessary for the human body as well. The challenges module allows the user to compete with their friends on a leaderboard, motivating them to pursue a healthy lifestyle.
